ðŸ“„ Troubleshooting OCSP Certificate Errors in Streamlit + Snowflake (and Solution)
Problem
When deploying a Streamlit app that connects to Snowflake, the following errors were happening:

OperationalError: 254007: The certificate is revoked or could not be validated: hostname=xxx.snowflakecomputing.com

OperationalError: 250001: Could not connect to Snowflake backend after 2 attempt(s). Aborting

Certificate validation failed because of OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) checks.

Even disabling OCSP via connection settings was not enough â€” the app still failed.

Cause
Streamlit was first manually creating a Snowflake connection (with OCSP disabled).

But then Snowpark's Session.builder.configs({...}).create() created a new fresh connection, without OCSP disabled.

So OCSP checking was still happening on that second connection â€” and causing the SSL validation to fail.

Solution
To fully disable OCSP checking across both Snowflake Connector and Snowpark Session:

Manually create the Snowflake connector connection with disable_ocsp_checks=True:

python
Copy
Edit
conn = snowflake.connector.connect(
    user=st.secrets["user"],
    password=st.secrets["password"],
    account=st.secrets["account"],
    warehouse=st.secrets["warehouse"],
    database=st.secrets["database"],
    schema=st.secrets["schema"],
    role=st.secrets["role"],
    disable_ocsp_checks=True
)
Pass the manual connection into Snowpark Session.builder:

python
Copy
Edit
session = Session.builder.configs({
    "connection": conn,
    "ocsp_fail_open": True  # optional extra safety inside Snowpark
}).create()
This ensures only one connection is made â€” with OCSP checking completely disabled.

Important Notes
You must pass the conn object to Snowpark's builder using "connection": conn.

Just adding "ocsp_fail_open": True inside configs is not enough alone â€” you still need to supply your own connection.

Snowflake Connector version must be 3.14.0+ for disable_ocsp_checks to work.

Why this happens
Snowflake enforces strict SSL validation by default.

If OCSP servers are unreachable or certificates are misconfigured, connections will fail.

Disabling OCSP allows the app to proceed even if OCSP validation cannot complete.
